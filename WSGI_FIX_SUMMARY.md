# WSGI Deployment Fix - Issue #10

## Problem
The application was failing to deploy on Render with the error:
```
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'run'
```

## Root Cause
The `create_app()` function in `app/__init__.py` was returning a tuple `(app, socketio)` instead of just the Flask application object. This caused `wsgi.py` to receive a tuple when it expected a Flask app.

## Solution
1. **Fixed `create_app()` function**: Modified `app/__init__.py` to return only the Flask app object, with the socketio instance stored as an attribute (`app.socketio`)

2. **Updated all dependent files**: Updated 8 files that were expecting the tuple return value:
   - `run.py`
   - `debug_rag_dashboard.py` 
   - `run_simple_stable.py`
   - `run_stable.py`
   - `run_ultra_simple.py`
   - `test_fixes_verification.py`
   - `test_rag_route.py`
   - `test_websocket.py`

## Changes Made

### `app/__init__.py`
```python
# Before:
return app, socketio

# After:
return app
```

### All dependent files
```python
# Before:
app, socketio = create_app()

# After:
app = create_app()
socketio = app.socketio
```

## Verification
- Created and ran `test_wsgi_fix.py` to verify the fix
- Confirmed that `wsgi.py` now correctly receives a Flask app object
- All tests pass successfully

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes the deployment error on Render
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility through `app.socketio` attribute
- ✅ No functional changes to the application behavior
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

The application should now deploy successfully on Render without the AttributeError.
