# Configure Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200-1500) data sources

You can configure Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) controller data source in the SIMATIC S7 Connector application. The configurator allows you to configure the Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) communication channel to the SIMATIC PLCs for data acquisition.

## Example Scenario

A Plant Administrator or Industrial Edge Box Operator would like to configure the data acquisition from the Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) controller, and subsequently would like to create value from the acquired data.

## Prerequisite

* The SIMATIC S7 Connector must be running.
* The Common Connector Configurator must be running.

## Procedure

To configure Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) controller data source, follow these steps:

1. Launch the SIMATIC S7 Connector application.<br/>
  The configurator home page is displayed.
1. Click **Add Data Source** in the upper-left corner.<br/>
  The **Add** dialog box is displayed as follows:<br/>
  ![171299003275-d2e1782](../media/171299003275.png)
1. Select the Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) data source from the **Data Source Type** drop-down.<br/>
  The fields are displayed as follows:<br/>
  ![171299357067-d2e1793](../media/171299357067.png)
1. Complete the following fields:<br/>

      | Field Name | Definition |
      | --- | --- |
      | Name | Defines the name of the data source. It must be unique. |
      | PLC Type | Specifies the PLC type. |
      | IP Address | Defines the IP address of the Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500) controller with the desired data points. |
      | Use Legitimization | When selected, **Access password** is used to acquire the legitimization on server. Not selecting this option is equivalent to the access level **Full Access** (no protection). |
      | Access Password | Defines the access password. This field is enabled when you select **Use Legitimization**. The available access level which requires access password on the PLC are as follows: <ol><li>No Access (Complete Protection)</li><li>HMI Access</li><li>Read Access</li></ol><br/>Use corresponding access level password configured on the PLC in this field. |
      | EndEntity Certificate | Device Certificate. Optimized S7 connection expects one end-entity certificate on HMI Connection-level configured by an ES. If this information is available, it is used when establishing connections to the PLC configured on the HMI Connection. |
      | Root Certificate | CA Certificate. CA Certificate  are used to build a chain of trust for an end-entity certificate of a PLC. Those certificates are trusted by Optimized S7 connection, because they are provided by an ES (e.g. by TIA Portal's WinCC ES); the certificates are most likely generated by TIA Portal. |

      \* Indicates that all fields are mandatory.

1. Click **Add**.<br/>
  The data source is added and displayed in the **Data Source** table.

    !!! info "NOTICE"

        If **Use global security settings for certificate manager** checkbox is enabled under  Device Properties > Protection and Security > Certificate manager and PLC FW is 2.9, user has to ensure that TLS certificate is configured in the PLC in order to connect with the PLC using Optimized S7 connection.
