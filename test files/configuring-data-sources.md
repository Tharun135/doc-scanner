# Configuring data sources

A data source is a field device which provides the data. You can configure the SIMATIC S7 Connector to the field devices to consume the acquired data in the IED for value creation.

The SIMATIC S7 Connector supports the following two communication channels:

1. S7-Protocol (S7-300/400/1200/1500)
1. Optimized S7-Protocol (S7-1200/1500)
