# Test Document for Progress Analysis

This is a test document to demonstrate the new progressive analysis feature with percentage indicators.

## Introduction
The document analysis system has been enhanced to provide real-time progress updates during the analysis process. Users can now see exactly what stage the analysis is at and how much has been completed.

## Features
The new progress system includes:
- Real-time percentage updates (0% to 100%)
- Stage indicators showing current processing step
- Detailed status messages for each phase
- Smooth progress bar animation
- Better user experience during analysis

## Analysis Stages
The system breaks down analysis into several key stages:

1. **Parsing Stage (10%)**: The system reads and parses the uploaded document, extracting text content from various file formats including TXT, DOCX, PDF, and Markdown files.

2. **Segmentation Stage (20%)**: The document is broken down into individual sentences using advanced natural language processing techniques with spaCy models.

3. **Analysis Stage (20-90%)**: Each sentence is analyzed against the comprehensive rule set. This is the longest stage as it processes each sentence individually for grammar, style, and content issues.

4. **Reporting Stage (95%)**: The system generates a comprehensive analysis report with quality metrics, issue counts, and recommendations.

5. **Completion Stage (100%)**: Final results are prepared and presented to the user with all feedback items properly categorized and linked.

## Benefits
This progressive approach provides several advantages:
- Users know the system is working and haven't stalled
- Clear indication of remaining time and effort
- Better understanding of the analysis complexity
- Professional user experience similar to modern applications

## Technical Implementation
The backend uses Flask with Server-Sent Events for real-time updates, while the frontend displays an animated progress bar with percentage indicators and stage descriptions.

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience, especially for larger documents that require more processing time.
