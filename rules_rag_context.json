  {
    "issue": "Long sentence",
    "suggestion": "Split into multiple meaningful sentences.",
    "rag_context": "Readers process short sentences more easily. Each sentence should convey one idea. Avoid chaining multiple clauses or using excessive conjunctions. Example: 'The application runs diagnostics and reports errors, and then logs them into the system automatically.' → 'The application runs diagnostics and reports errors. It then logs them into the system automatically.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Passive voice",
    "suggestion": "Rewrite the sentence in active voice.",
    "rag_context": "Passive voice hides who performs the action, making writing indirect. Convert to active voice by placing the doer before the verb. Example: 'The issue was resolved by the developer' → 'The developer resolved the issue.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Vague terms",
    "suggestion": "Replace vague or subjective words with precise technical terms.",
    "rag_context": "Vague terms weaken clarity. Use concrete, measurable, or specific words instead of generic adjectives. Example: 'The system works fine.' → 'The system completes the data upload without errors.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Inconsistent terminology",
    "suggestion": "Ensure consistent use of product and feature names throughout the document.",
    "rag_context": "Using inconsistent terms confuses readers. Use one consistent term for each concept or feature. Example: 'Device Manager' and 'Controller App' should not be used interchangeably unless defined. Maintain a glossary for reference."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Style inconsistency",
    "suggestion": "Follow the approved documentation style guide for tone, formatting, and usage.",
    "rag_context": "Inconsistent capitalization, punctuation, or tone reduces professionalism. Apply the style guide consistently across headings, lists, and steps. Example: if 'Click Save' is your standard, avoid 'Press save button'."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Verb tense inconsistency",
    "suggestion": "Maintain consistent verb tense throughout the procedure or paragraph.",
    "rag_context": "Switching tenses confuses readers about the timeline of actions. In technical documents, use simple present for general instructions. Example: 'The system was starting automatically' → 'The system starts automatically.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Wordiness or redundancy",
    "suggestion": "Remove unnecessary words to make sentences concise.",
    "rag_context": "Concise writing improves readability. Eliminate filler words like 'basically', 'in order to', 'as a matter of fact'. Example: 'In order to start the process, click Start.' → 'To start the process, click Start.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Grammatical errors",
    "suggestion": "Correct subject–verb agreement, article usage, and punctuation errors.",
    "rag_context": "Grammar errors reduce credibility. Use tools like spaCy or LanguageTool to detect errors, and follow standard English grammar rules. Example: 'The data are stored securely' (not 'is stored')."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Title capitalization",
    "suggestion": "Capitalize titles according to style guide rules (e.g., title case).",
    "rag_context": "Consistent title formatting improves readability. Follow the rule: capitalize the first and last words and all major words. Example: 'installing the Application' → 'Installing the Application'."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Ambiguous references",
    "suggestion": "Clarify unclear references like 'it', 'this', or 'that'.",
    "rag_context": "Ambiguous pronouns make readers guess what is being referred to. Replace with specific nouns. Example: 'It restarts automatically' → 'The service restarts automatically.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Improper list structure",
    "suggestion": "Use parallel structure and consistent punctuation in lists.",
    "rag_context": "Parallelism in lists improves flow and comprehension. Example: instead of 'Click Save, Logging out, and You may close the window', write 'Click Save, Log out, and Close the window.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Complex sentence structure",
    "suggestion": "Simplify nested clauses for clarity.",
    "rag_context": "Complex sentences with multiple dependent clauses are hard to follow. Break them into simpler ones. Example: 'When the server is restarted after maintenance, which usually happens weekly, all temporary sessions are cleared.' → 'The server is restarted weekly after maintenance. All temporary sessions are cleared.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Improper punctuation",
    "suggestion": "Ensure proper use of commas, semicolons, and periods.",
    "rag_context": "Punctuation affects readability. Use commas to separate clauses and avoid run-on sentences. Example: 'After installation click Start' → 'After installation, click Start.'"
  },
  {
    "issue": "Inconsistent formatting",
    "suggestion": "Maintain consistent use of bold, italics, and code formatting.",
    "rag_context": "Formatting inconsistencies distract readers. Use bold for UI elements, italics for emphasis, and code blocks for commands. Example: use **Save** not 'save'."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Use of jargon",
    "suggestion": "Replace technical jargon with simpler terms unless the audience is expert-level.",
    "rag_context": "Too much jargon alienates non-technical readers. Replace niche terms with common equivalents or provide definitions. Example: 'Instantiate a class' → 'Create an object'."
  },
  {
    "issue": "Improper numbering",
    "suggestion": "Use numbered steps for sequences and bullets for unordered lists.",
    "rag_context": "Numbered lists help readers follow sequential instructions. Example: '1. Open Settings. 2. Click System. 3. Select Network.'"
