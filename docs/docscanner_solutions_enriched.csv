MOD-consistency_rules,"Consistency (Capitalization, Spelling, Format)","Choose one style and apply it uniformly. Typical fixes:
• Capitalization: Sentence case for headings unless title case is your standard; match UI casing exactly for labels.
• Spelling variants: Pick 'color' or 'colour' and use consistently across the manual.
• Number formatting: Use the same thousands separator and unit style.
• Lists: Keep parallel structure and consistent punctuation.",Consistency enhances readability and brand voice.,MSTP: Capitalization; Company Style Guide
MOD-grammar_rules,"General Grammar (Agreement, Articles, Punctuation)","Apply targeted fixes:
• Subject–verb agreement: 'Data is' → 'Data are' (or treat as singular consistently by rephrasing).
• Articles: Add 'the/a/an' where needed; remove unnecessary 'the' before proper nouns.
• Commas: Use comma before coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses; remove comma splices.",Correct grammar ensures professionalism and prevents misreading.,Chicago Manual of Style; MSTP Grammar
MOD-long_sentence,Long/Complex Sentence,"Split into shorter sentences, each conveying one idea. Remove filler clauses and convert enumerations to lists.
Heuristics: Break at coordinating conjunctions (and/but/so), relative clauses (which/that), and parentheticals.
Examples:
• 'After you install the package, which requires admin rights, you should restart the system so that services can reload' →
  'Install the package (requires admin rights). Then restart the system to reload services.'
• Convert chains like 'and then, and then' into step-by-step bullets.",Short sentences improve readability and scanning; they reduce cognitive load and lower reading grade level.,MSTP: Readability; Plain Language Guidelines
MOD-nominalizations,Nominalizations (-tion/-ment Nouns),"Prefer strong verbs over abstract nouns formed from verbs. Convert 'make a configuration' → 'configure'.
Patterns:
• 'provide a description of' → 'describe'
• 'perform a check' → 'check'
• 'give consideration to' → 'consider'",Using verbs reduces wordiness and improves clarity.,Plain Language Guidelines; MSTP: Word choice
MOD-passive_voice,Passive Voice,"Rewrite in active voice with an explicit actor and imperative mood for steps.
Pattern: '<object> was/ were/ is/ are <past participle> (by <agent>)' → '<agent> <base verb> <object>'.
For procedural steps, prefer: '<agent>' omitted → 'Click the button', 'Open the file'.
Examples:
• 'The button was clicked' → 'Click the button'.
• 'Logs are generated by the service' → 'The service generates logs' (or 'Generate logs' if it's an instruction).","Active voice makes instructions clearer, shorter, and aligns with Microsoft Style Guide/MSTP recommendations for procedural content.",MSTP: Voice and tone; Microsoft Style Guide 'Use active voice'
MOD-readability_rules,Readability (Grade Level),"Lower the reading level:
• Replace complex words with common alternatives ('utilize' → 'use').
• Keep sentences under ~20 words when possible.
• Prefer lists and tables for dense information.",Plain language improves comprehension for a broad audience.,Plainlanguage.gov; MSTP Readability
MOD-style_rules,"Style & Tone (Second Person, Parallelism)","Prefer second person ('you'), active voice, and concise sentences. Maintain parallel structure in lists.
Examples:
• 'The user should click the Start button' → 'Click Start'.
• Non-parallel: 'Click Start', 'Opening Settings', 'Then you configure' → Parallel: 'Click Start', 'Open Settings', 'Configure…'","A consistent, direct style helps users complete tasks faster.",MSTP: Voice and tone; Parallelism
MOD-terminology_rules,Terminology Consistency,"Use the preferred term from the glossary consistently. Replace synonyms and product nicknames.
Steps:
1) Identify offending term → 2) Look up preferred form in glossary → 3) Replace globally with correct capitalization.
Examples:
• 'login' (noun) vs 'log in' (verb): 'Log in to the app.' / 'Enter your login.'
• 'OK' vs 'OK' button (avoid 'Okay').","Consistent terminology reduces user confusion, improves searchability, and matches UI labels.",MSTP: Terminology; Microsoft Style Guide 'UI text'
MOD-title_utils,Titles and Headings,"Make headings task-oriented, concise, and consistent in casing.
• Use nouns or gerunds for reference topics; imperatives for how-tos.
• Avoid trailing punctuation and articles at the start unless needed.
• Keep to ~60 characters when possible.","Clear headings improve navigation and SEO, and set user expectations.",MSTP: Headings; Google Developer Docs Style
MOD-vague_terms,Vague or Ambiguous Terms,"Replace vague words with precise alternatives or quantify them. Examples:
• 'some', 'various', 'several' → provide an exact number or list.
• 'should', 'might', 'may' (when instructing) → use imperative: 'Click', 'Select'.
• 'etc.' → remove or complete the list.
• 'soon', 'later', 'quickly' → specify time or criteria.
Rewrite example: 'Wait for some time' → 'Wait 30 seconds until the status shows Ready'.",Specific language prevents misinterpretation and improves testability of procedures.,MSTP: Word choice; NIST Technical Writing Guidelines
MOD-verb_tense,Verb Tense (Procedural Style),"Use simple present and the imperative mood for steps; simple present for facts; past tense only for historical context.
Fix patterns:
• Future 'will' → present: 'The system will display…' → 'The system displays…'.
• Past in steps → imperative: 'The user clicked…' → 'Click…'.
• Ensure parallel tense within a list of steps.",Consistent tense improves flow; imperative is standard for procedures.,MSTP: Verbs and tense; Chicago 5.120
