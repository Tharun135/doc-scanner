This is a test document to verify that the RAG system properly adds new uploads.

# Test Document for Upload Verification

## Introduction
This document is specifically created to test whether the upload functionality correctly adds new documents to the existing knowledge base without replacing the existing content.

## Key Features to Test
1. **Incremental Addition**: New documents should be added to existing ones, not replace them
2. **Count Tracking**: The dashboard should show increased document counts
3. **Search Integration**: New content should be searchable alongside existing documents

## Expected Behavior
When this document is uploaded:
- The total chunk count should increase
- The dashboard should reflect the new count
- Search functionality should include this content
- Existing documents should remain intact

## Technical Details
The upload system should:
- Process this document into multiple chunks
- Add chunks to the ChromaDB collection without deleting existing ones
- Update the TF-IDF index to include new content
- Maintain metadata for proper retrieval

## Conclusion
If you can see this document in your search results and the dashboard shows an increased count, the upload fix was successful!
