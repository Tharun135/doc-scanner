```

### 🔥 **Method 3: Import Existing Documents**

```python
def import_document_collection(folder_path):
    """Import multiple documents from a folder."""
    import os
    
    supported_formats = ['.txt', '.md', '.docx']
    
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):

            file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
            
            if filename.endswith('.txt') or filename.endswith('.md'):
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    content = f.read()
            elif filename.endswith('.docx'):
                # Requires python-docx: pip install python-docx
                from docx import Document
                doc = Document(file_path)
                content = '\n'.join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])
            
            llamaindex_ai_engine.add_document_to_knowledge(
                content=content,
                metadata={
                    "type": "imported_document",
                    "source": filename,
                    "folder": folder_path
                }
            )
            print(f"✅ Imported: {filename}")

# Usage - import all style guides from a folder
import_document_collection("style_guides/")

)
```

### 🔥 **Method 5: Learning from User Feedback**

```python
def add_user_feedback_patterns():
    """Add patterns based on common user corrections."""
    feedback_patterns = """
    Common User Corrections Database:
    
    Frequently Fixed Issues:
    - Users often change "utilize" to "use"

        metadata={"type": "user_feedback", "source": "analytics"}
    )
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Enhancement Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Domain-Specific Templates**

Create templates for different document types:

```python
def add_document_templates():
    templates = {
        "api_documentation": """
        API Documentation Template:
        1. Overview and purpose

        """,
        
        "business_proposal": """
        Business Proposal Template:
        1. Executive summary (problem + solution)
        2. Current situation analysis

        5. Budget and resource requirements
        6. Expected outcomes and metrics
        7. Risk assessment and mitigation
        8. Next steps and call-to-action
        """
    }
    
    for template_type, content in templates.items():
        llamaindex_ai_engine.add_document_to_knowledge(
            content=content,
            metadata={"type": "template", "document_type": template_type}
        )

    Readability Scores:
    - Flesch Reading Ease: Target 60-70 (standard)
    - Flesch-Kincaid Grade: Target 8th-10th grade
    - Gunning Fog Index: Target under 12
    
    Sentence Structure:
    - Average sentence length: 15-20 words
    - Maximum sentence length: 25 words
    - Vary sentence lengths for flow
    
    Word Choice Quality:
    - Use common words over complex ones
    - Prefer active voice (80%+ target)
    - Minimize jargon and technical terms
    - Use specific nouns and strong verbs
    
    Document Structure:
    - Use clear headings and subheadings
    - Include summary sections
    - Use lists for multiple items
    - Provide clear navigation
    """
    
    llamaindex_ai_engine.add_document_to_knowledge(
        content=quality_guide,
        metadata={"type": "quality_metrics", "category": "standards"}
    )
```

## 🚀 **Automated Enhancement Script**

Create a script that runs daily/weekly to keep improving:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""

"""

def weekly_knowledge_update():
    """Run weekly to add new knowledge patterns."""
    
    # Add current writing trends
    current_trends = f"""
    Writing Trends Update - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}:

    """
    
    llamaindex_ai_engine.add_document_to_knowledge(
        content=current_trends,
        metadata={"type": "trends_update", "date": datetime.now().isoformat()}
    )
    
    print("✅ Weekly knowledge update completed")

def analyze_and_improve():
    """Analyze usage patterns and improve accordingly."""
    # This could integrate with your app's analytics
    print("📊 Analyzing usage patterns...")
    print("🔧 Adding improvements based on user behavior...")
    print("✅ Knowledge base optimized for current usage")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    weekly_knowledge_update()
    analyze_and_improve()
```

## 📈 **Measuring Improvement Impact**

Track how your enhancements improve suggestion quality:

```python
def measure_knowledge_impact():
    """Measure the impact of knowledge base improvements."""
    
    # Test with sample texts before and after enhancement
    test_cases = [
        "The report was written by the team and it was completed yesterday.",
        "In order to utilize the application, users may click on the button.",
        "The system will be configured by the administrator to ensure proper functionality."
    ]
    
    print("🧪 TESTING KNOWLEDGE BASE IMPROVEMENTS")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    for i, test_text in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
        print(f"\n📝 Test Case {i}: '{test_text}'")
        
        # Generate suggestion
        from app.ai_improvement import ai_engine
        result = ai_engine.generate_contextual_suggestion(
            feedback_text="improve this sentence",
            sentence_context=test_text
        )
        
        print(f"💡 Suggestion: {result.get('suggestion', 'No suggestion')}")
        print(f"🎯 Method: {result.get('method', 'Unknown')}")
        print(f"📊 Confidence: {result.get('confidence', 'Unknown')}")

# Run to see improvements
measure_knowledge_impact()
