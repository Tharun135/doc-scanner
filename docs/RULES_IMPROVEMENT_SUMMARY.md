# Document Scanner Rules Analysis and Improvements

## Overview

Comprehensive analysis and enhancement of the document scanner rules system to improve document quality assessment and suggestions.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Existing Rules

#### accessibility_terms.py

- **Expanded person-first language**: Added comprehensive patterns for person-first language with specific suggestions
- **Added outdated terms detection**: New Rule 7 to catch outdated or offensive disability-related terms
- **Color-only instruction detection**: New Rule 8 to identify instructions that rely solely on color

#### technical_terms.py

- **Comprehensive capitalization rules**: Added rules for API, URL, HTML, CSS, JSON, etc.
- **File extension consistency**: Ensures lowercase file extensions
- **Product name capitalization**: Detects and corrects product names (Microsoft, Windows, macOS, etc.)
- **Unit abbreviation suggestions**: Recommends standard abbreviations for technical units

#### concise_simple_words.py

- **Expanded intensifier detection**: More comprehensive list of unnecessary modifiers
- **Nominalization detection**: Identifies and suggests replacements for verb nominalizations
- **Redundant word pairs**: Detects and suggests corrections for redundant expressions
- **Enhanced weak verb patterns**: More sophisticated detection of wordy constructions

### 2. New Rules Created

#### redundant_phrases.py

- Detects and suggests replacements for redundant prepositional phrases
- Identifies unnecessary intensifiers and modifiers
- Catches complex constructions and double negatives
- Provides specific alternatives for wordy expressions

#### document_structure.py

- **Heading hierarchy validation**: Ensures proper H1→H2→H3 progression
- **List formatting consistency**: Checks for consistent bullet points and numbering
- **Step numbering validation**: Verifies sequential numbering in procedures
- **Capitalization consistency**: Analyzes heading capitalization patterns
- **Spacing consistency**: Identifies indentation and blank line issues

#### inclusive_language.py

- **Gender-neutral alternatives**: Comprehensive detection of gendered terms with suggestions
- **Technical terminology**: Identifies potentially problematic tech terms (master/slave, whitelist/blacklist)
- **Ability assumptions**: Detects language that assumes physical abilities
- **Cultural assumptions**: Flags words like "obviously" in instructional contexts
- **Economic assumptions**: Identifies language that assumes purchasing power

#### cross_references.py

- **Internal reference consistency**: Validates section reference formatting
- **Link quality assessment**: Checks for descriptive link text and external link indicators
- **Citation consistency**: Ensures uniform citation formatting
- **Figure/table references**: Validates that all references have corresponding captions

#### tone_voice.py

- **Formality consistency**: Detects mixed formal/informal language
- **Person consistency**: Ensures consistent use of 1st/2nd/3rd person
- **Professional tone**: Identifies potentially unprofessional language
- **Sentence variety**: Analyzes rhythm and variety in sentence structure
- **Hedging language**: Detects excessive uncertainty or qualification

#### readability_metrics.py

- **Comprehensive readability analysis**: Calculates Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Fog Index
- **Sentence complexity analysis**: Provides specific suggestions based on metrics
- **Vocabulary complexity**: Identifies complex words with simpler alternatives
- **Paragraph structure**: Analyzes paragraph length and organization
- **Transition usage**: Evaluates flow and connectivity between ideas

#### spelling_checker.py

- **Multi-layered spell checking**: Uses pyspellchecker library with fallback to common misspellings
- **Technical term awareness**: Avoids false positives for programming terms, APIs, and technical jargon
- **Context-aware corrections**: Provides surrounding text context for better error understanding
- **Multiple correction suggestions**: Offers alternative spellings when multiple options exist
- **Smart filtering**: Skips proper nouns, acronyms, and likely technical terms automatically

### 3. System-Level Improvements

#### Enhanced Error Handling

- All rules now use consistent spaCy loading through `spacy_utils.py`
- Proper fallback mechanisms when dependencies are unavailable
- Improved error handling and logging

#### RAG Integration

- All new rules support RAG enhancement when available
- Fallback to rule-based detection maintains functionality
- Consistent interface for RAG integration

#### Performance Optimizations

- Shared spaCy model instance to reduce memory usage
- Efficient regex patterns to minimize processing time
- Smart text preprocessing to avoid redundant operations
