# üß† DocScanner RAG System - Complete Technical Explanation

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

Your DocScanner now uses a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines:
- **Local AI Models** (Ollama with TinyLLaMA/Mistral/Phi3/Llama3)
- **Vector Storage** (ChromaDB for semantic search)  
- **RAG Framework** (LlamaIndex for intelligent retrieval)
- **39+ Writing Rules** converted to searchable knowledge base

**Result**: AI-powered writing suggestions that are private, fast, and contextually intelligent.

### **System Components**

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **LLM Runtime** | Ollama | Hosts local AI models |
| **AI Models** | TinyLLaMA, Mistral, Phi3, Llama3 | Generate intelligent suggestions |
| **Vector Store** | ChromaDB | Semantic search of writing rules |
| **RAG Framework** | LlamaIndex | Connects LLM + Vector Store |
| **Rule Engine** | Python Pattern Matching | Detects writing issues |
| **Fallback System** | Smart Logic | Works when AI unavailable |

## üîÑ **How RAG Works - Step by Step**

### **Phase 1: Document Processing**
```python
# 1. User uploads document
document = "The report was written by John yesterday."

# 2. HTML parsing and text extraction
clean_text = extract_text(document)  # "The report was written by John yesterday."
```

### **Phase 2: Rule-Based Detection**
```python
# 3. Traditional rule scanning (39+ rules)
from app.rules.passive_voice import check
detected_issues = check(document)

# Output: [{"text": "was written by", "issue": "passive voice detected"}]
```

### **Phase 3: RAG Enhancement** 
```python
# 4. For each detected issue, enhance with RAG
issue = "Passive voice detected: 'was written by'"
sentence = "The report was written by John yesterday."

# 5. Search writing rule knowledge base
relevant_rules = vector_search(
    query=issue,
    knowledge_base=writing_rules_db,
    top_k=2
)
```

### **Phase 4: Contextual AI Generation**
```python
# 6. Build intelligent prompt
prompt = f"""
Fix this writing issue: {issue}
Original sentence: "{sentence}"
Document type: technical
Relevant rules: {relevant_rules}

Provide a complete rewrite that fixes the issue.
Make it clear, direct, and professional.
"""

# 7. Generate with local AI
suggestion = ollama_model.generate(prompt)
# Output: "John wrote the report yesterday."
```

### **Phase 5: Smart Fallback**
```python
# 8. If RAG fails, use rule-based fallback
if rag_suggestion is None:
    fallback = "Convert passive voice to active voice for clarity"
    return {"suggestion": fallback, "method": "rule_based"}
else:
    return {"suggestion": rag_suggestion, "method": "ollama_local_rag"}
```

---

## üìö **Knowledge Base Structure**

Your RAG system has a searchable database of writing expertise:

### **Built-in Writing Rules** (39+ rules converted to embeddings)
```json
{
  "rule_id": "passive_voice_001",
  "text": "Convert passive voice to active voice. Change 'was written by John' to 'John wrote'. Put the actor first, then the action.",
  "category": "passive_voice",
  "examples": ["The report was written ‚Üí John wrote the report"],
  "vector_embedding": [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]
}
```

### **Custom Knowledge Base** (`custom_writing_rules.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "text": "Use 'click' instead of 'click on' in UI instructions",
    "category": "ui_writing", 
    "examples": ["Click the button (not: click on the button)"]
  },
  {
    "text": "Write numbers 1-9 as words, 10+ as numerals in body text",
    "category": "style_guide",
    "examples": ["Five users tested it, but 12 reported issues"]
  }
]
```

## üß† **AI Model Intelligence Levels**

Your system adapts to available models:

| Model | Size | Quality | Use Case |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **TinyLLaMA** | 637MB | Basic | ‚úÖ Always works, basic suggestions |
| **Phi3:mini** | 2.2GB | Good | Efficient reasoning, better grammar |
| **Mistral** | 4.4GB | High | Excellent writing assistance |
| **Llama3:8b** | 4.7GB | Highest | Premium suggestions, best context |

### **Smart Model Selection**
```python
def auto_select_model():
    models = ['mistral', 'phi3', 'llama3', 'tinyllama']
    for model in models:
        try:
            if test_model_memory(model):
                return initialize_model(model)
        except MemoryError:
            continue  # Try next smaller model
    
    return None  # Fall back to rule-based suggestions
```

---

## üîå **Integration Points**

### **1. Rule Integration**
Every writing rule now follows this pattern:

```python
# app/rules/passive_voice.py
def check(content):
    if RAG_AVAILABLE:
        # Enhanced mode: RAG + rules
        return check_with_rag(
            content=content,
            rule_patterns={'detect_function': detect_passive_voice},
            rule_name="passive_voice",
            fallback_suggestions=["Convert to active voice"]
        )
    else:
        # Legacy mode: rules only
        return check_legacy(content)
```

### **2. Web Interface Integration**
```javascript
// Frontend shows enhanced suggestions
{
  "text": "was written by John",
  "message": "ü§ñ AI Enhanced: John wrote the report yesterday.",
  "method": "ollama_local_rag",
  "model": "tinyllama:latest",
  "context": {
    "local_ai": true,
    "private": true,
    "cost": "free"
  }
}
```

### **3. Performance Monitoring**
```python
# Real-time performance tracking
{
  "rag_requests": 127,
  "rag_successes": 119, 
  "fallback_used": 8,
  "avg_response_time": "0.8s",
  "model_in_use": "tinyllama:latest",
  "memory_usage": "2.1GB"
}
```

## üéØ **Real-World Example**

### **Input Document**
```markdown
# Project Report

The configuration settings were updated by the development team. 
The changes should be reviewed carefully before deployment.
This is a very long sentence that contains many complex ideas and should probably be broken down into shorter, more digestible pieces for better readability and user comprehension.
```

### **RAG Processing**

**Step 1**: Rule Detection
```python
Issues Found:
1. Passive voice: "were updated by" 
2. Modal verb: "should be reviewed"
3. Long sentence: 43 words (recommend <20)
```

**Step 2**: Vector Search
```python
# Search knowledge base for relevant rules
query = "passive voice were updated by"
results = [
  {
    "rule": "Convert passive to active voice", 
    "score": 0.89,
    "example": "Change 'was done by X' to 'X did'"
  }
]
```

**Step 3**: AI Enhancement
```python
# Generate with local TinyLLaMA
prompt = "Fix passive voice: 'were updated by the development team'"
ai_output = "The development team updated the configuration settings."
```

**Step 4**: Enhanced Output
```json
{
  "original": "The configuration settings were updated by the development team.",
  "suggestion": "The development team updated the configuration settings.",
  "method": "ollama_local_rag",
  "model": "tinyllama:latest",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "rule_source": "passive_voice_conversion",
  "context": {
    "private": true,
    "local": true,
    "cost": "free"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ **Advanced Features**

### **1. Custom Knowledge Base**
Add your organization's writing guidelines:

```json
// custom_writing_rules.json
[
  {
    "text": "Use 'Acme Corp' not 'ACME' in all documentation",
    "category": "brand_style",
    "examples": ["Acme Corp released the update (not: ACME released)"]
  }
]
```

### **2. Document Type Awareness**
```python
# RAG adapts suggestions based on document type
get_rag_suggestion(
    issue="passive voice detected",
    sentence="The bug was fixed by engineering",
    document_type="technical",  # vs "marketing", "legal", etc.
)

# Output varies by context:
# Technical: "Engineering fixed the bug"
# Marketing: "Our engineering team resolved the issue"
```

### **3. Multi-Model Fallback Chain**
```python
# Automatic model degradation for reliability
model_chain = [
    "mistral:latest",    # Try premium model first
    "phi3:mini",         # Fall back to efficient model  
    "tinyllama:latest",  # Always-reliable fallback
    "rule_based"         # Final fallback to traditional rules
]
```
