# Test Document for WebSocket Progress

This is a simple test document to verify that our real-time progress tracking system is working correctly with WebSocket connections.

## Key Features Being Tested:

1. **WebSocket Connection**: The frontend should connect to the Flask-SocketIO server
2. **Real-time Progress Updates**: Progress should update in real-time based on actual backend processing
3. **Stage Tracking**: Each processing stage should be accurately reflected in the UI
4. **ETA Calculation**: The estimated time remaining should be calculated based on actual processing time

## Sample Content:

This document contains multiple sentences to ensure there's enough content for the analysis stages to be visible. The system should process this content through all five stages:

- Upload (10%)
- Parse (30%) 
- Extract (50%)
- Analyze (80%)
- Report (100%)

The progress bar should now reflect actual processing time rather than simulated delays.
