SOLUTION: Fixed Passive Voice Detection and Transformation
==========================================================

This addresses the specific issue you reported:
"Delete the languages that are not needed" was not being transformed correctly.

The problem was in our passive voice detection - the system was identifying 
passive voice correctly but not transforming it properly.

HOW TO USE THE FIXED PASSIVE VOICE SYSTEM:

1. SIMPLE USAGE:
   from complete_integration import quick_fix
   
   corrected = quick_fix("Delete the languages that are not needed.", "Passive voice")
   print(corrected)  # "Delete the unneeded languages"

2. FULL INTEGRATION:
   from complete_integration import DocScannerAI
   
   ai = DocScannerAI()
   result = ai.get_smart_suggestion(sentence, "Passive voice")
   
   # Show user both original and corrected
   print(f"Original: {result['original']}")
   print(f"Improved: {result['corrected']}")
   print(f"Why: {result['explanation']}")

3. IN YOUR DOCSCANNER CODE:
   # When you detect passive voice
   if issue_type == "Passive voice":
       ai_suggestion = ai.get_smart_suggestion(flagged_sentence, "Passive voice")
       
       # Display to user
       show_suggestion(
           original=flagged_sentence,
           corrected=ai_suggestion['corrected'],
           explanation=ai_suggestion['explanation'],
           confidence=ai_suggestion['confidence']
       )

4. BATCH PROCESSING:
   # Process multiple passive voice issues
   passive_issues = [
       {'sentence': 'Delete languages that are not needed.', 'issue': 'Passive voice'},
       {'sentence': 'Files are processed by the system.', 'issue': 'Passive voice'}
   ]
   
   results = ai.process_document_issues(passive_issues)
   for suggestion in results['suggestions']:
       print(f"Fixed: {suggestion['corrected']}")
""")
