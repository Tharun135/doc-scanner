Identify the agent (who performs the action)\n2. Use active verb form (uploaded, not 'was uploaded')\n3. Place agent as subject\n4. Use present tense when possible\n5. Maintain original meaning",

BRACKET PATTERNS:\n   - '[agent] [verb] [object]' → 'agent verb object'\n   - Example: '[user] uploads [file]' → 'user uploads file'\n\n3. QUOTED CONVERSIONS:\n   - Direct quoted active voice versions\n   - Example: \"The user uploaded the file.\"\n\n4. PASSIVE INDICATORS TO REMOVE:\n   - 'was/were + past participle'\n   - 'is/are + past participle' \n   - 'can be + past participle'\n   - 'has been + past participle'\n\n5. ACTIVE CONVERSION RULES:\n   - Move agent to subject position\n   - Change passive verb to active form\n   - Maintain tense when possible\n   - Remove unnecessary prepositions ('by')",

TENSE PRESERVATION:\n   - Past passive → Past active\n   - Present passive → Present active\n   - Future passive → Future active\n   - Modal passive → Modal active\n\n5.
