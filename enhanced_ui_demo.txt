This is a comprehensive test document designed to showcase the enhanced circular progress indicator and progressive analysis features of the Doc Scanner application.

The new analyzing interface features a beautiful circular progress indicator with a rotating gradient ring that smoothly animates as the analysis progresses. The percentage is displayed prominently in the center with an attractive glowing effect.

Below the circular indicator, users will see a modern linear progress bar with a shimmer animation effect that adds visual appeal during the analysis process. The progress bar uses a gradient color scheme that transitions from gold to orange to red.

The interface includes stage indicators at the bottom that show the current phase of analysis: parsing, analysis, processing, and finalizing. Each stage lights up with different colors and animations as the process advances.

This document contains multiple sentences to demonstrate how the progressive analysis works in real-time. Users can observe the progress updates as each sentence is processed and analyzed for grammar, style, and readability issues.

The background of the loading overlay uses a beautiful gradient with blur effects to create a modern, professional appearance. The entire interface is designed to be both informative and visually engaging.

The circular progress indicator includes particle effects and rotating elements that make the waiting experience more pleasant for users. The animations are smooth and performance-optimized to ensure they don't interfere with the actual analysis process.

This enhanced user interface represents a significant improvement over traditional static loading screens and provides users with real-time feedback about the analysis progress.

The progressive analysis feature works seamlessly with both single files and batch processing, maintaining the same attractive visual feedback throughout the entire workflow.

Users will appreciate the professional appearance and smooth animations that make the document analysis process feel modern and responsive.
