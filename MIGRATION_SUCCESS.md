## 🎮 Pro Tips for Best Performance

### 1. **Optimize for Your Hardware**

**For 4-8GB RAM systems:**
```powershell
# Use lightweight models
ollama pull phi3:mini
echo "OLLAMA_MODEL=phi3:mini" > .env
```

**For 16GB+ RAM systems:**
```powershell
# Use full-featured models
ollama pull mistral
echo "OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral" > .env
```

### 2. **CPU vs GPU Usage**

If you encounter GPU memory issues:
```powershell
# Force CPU usage (slower but more reliable)
$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
ollama serve
```

### 3. **Background Processing**

Keep Ollama running in background:
```powershell
# Start Ollama service
Start-Process ollama -ArgumentList "serve" -WindowStyle Hidden
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### "Ollama Issues" (Not a Problem!)

**If you see Ollama errors:**
- ✅ **Your app still works perfectly** with smart fallbacks
- ✅ **All features remain available**
- ✅ **No functionality is lost**

**To fix Ollama (optional):**
```powershell
# Restart Ollama service
taskkill /f /im ollama.exe
ollama serve

# Try a smaller model
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

### "Import Errors"
