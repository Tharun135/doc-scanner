Test Document for Full Application

This document contains several issues to test our fixes:

1. Modal verb issues:
   - Permission: You may enter the building after 9 AM.
   - Possibility: The weather may change tomorrow.
   - Permission: Students may use the library on weekends.
   - Possibility: This approach may work better.

2. Special character issues:
   - Use the ampersand symbol (&) to connect ideas.
   - Research & development is important.
   - Sales & marketing teams work together.

3. Other grammar issues:
   - This is a very very long sentence that goes on and on without proper structure.
   - The document was written by the team.

This should test all our fixes comprehensively.
