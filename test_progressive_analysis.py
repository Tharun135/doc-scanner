    This is a test document to demonstrate the progressive analysis feature.
    
    The system should show real-time progress updates as it processes this document.
    Each sentence will be analyzed individually, and users can see the percentage completion.
    
    This sentence is intentionally written in passive voice to trigger some feedback.
    Complex grammatical structures and long sentences may also be detected by the analysis engine.
    
    The progress indicator shows different stages: parsing, segmentation, analysis, and reporting.
    Users will see animated progress bars and detailed status messages throughout the process.
    
    This enhancement significantly improves user experience during document analysis.
