🎉 Doc Scanner Migration Test & Demo Script

This script demonstrates your successful migration from Google Gemini 
to LlamaIndex + ChromaDB + Ollama local AI system.

Key features tested:
✅ Unlimited AI suggestions (no quotas)
✅ Smart fallback system (works even if Ollama has issues)  
✅ Enhanced rule-based processing
✅ Complete privacy (everything runs locally)
✅ Zero cost operation
