# Formatting Rule Modification Summary

## Problem
The original formatting rule flagged ALL spaces before punctuation, including those in legitimate list formatting where users might want spaces before periods in list items.

## Solution
Modified `app/rules/formatting_fixed.py` to be list-aware:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added helper function `_check_space_before_punctuation()`**:
   - Analyzes content line by line
   - Detects list items using patterns:
     - `^\s*[-*•·]\s` (bullet lists)
     - `^\s*\d+\.\s` (numbered lists)
   - Only flags spaces before punctuation in non-list lines

2. **Updated main `check()` function**:
   - Calls the new helper function instead of using the simple regex
   - Preserves all other formatting checks

### Behavior:

**✅ ALLOWED (No longer flagged):**
- `- The app must be running .` (list item with space before period)
- `• First item .` (bullet list with space before period)  
- `1. Numbered item .` (numbered list with space before period)
- `  - Indented item .` (indented list with space before period)

**❌ STILL FLAGGED (As expected):**
- `This is wrong . Regular text.` (space before period in regular text)
- `Hello , world` (space before comma in regular text)
- `What ? This is wrong.` (space before question mark in regular text)

### Test Results:
- User's original text: "The WinCC Unified Runtime app must be running." ✅ No longer flagged
- Regular text with spacing errors: Still properly flagged ✅
- Mixed content: Lists allowed, regular text still checked ✅

## Benefits:
1. **User-friendly**: Allows natural list formatting preferences
2. **Maintains quality**: Still catches formatting errors in regular text
3. **Flexible**: Supports various list styles (bullets, numbers, indented)
4. **Backward compatible**: All other formatting rules unchanged
