# Passive Voice - Complete Writing Guide

## What is Passive Voice?

**Passive voice** occurs when the subject of the sentence receives the action rather than performing it.

### Structure
- **Passive**: `[Subject] + [form of "to be"] + [past participle] + (by [agent])`
- **Active**: `[Agent/Subject] + [action verb] + [object]`

## When to Use Active Voice

### ✅ Use Active Voice For:

1. **Instructions and procedures**
   - "Click the Save button" (not "The Save button is clicked")
   - "Configure the network settings" (not "Network settings are configured")

2. **Direct user actions**
   - "You enter credentials" (not "Credentials are entered")
   - "You select the desired option" (not "The desired option is selected")

3. **System actions**
   - "The system validates input" (not "Input is validated by the system")
   - "The application displays results" (not "Results are displayed")

4. **Cause and effect**
   - "This action triggers a notification" (not "A notification is triggered")
   - "The error prevents access" (not "Access is prevented by the error")

---

## When Passive Voice is Acceptable

### ⚠️ Passive Voice May Be Used When:

1. **Agent is unknown or irrelevant**
   - "The data was corrupted" (we don't know how/who)
   - "The connection was lost" (focus on result, not cause)

2. **Emphasizing the action/result over the actor**
   - "The vulnerability was patched" (in security bulletins)
   - "The error has been fixed" (in release notes)

3. **Scientific/technical objectivity**
   - "The test was conducted under controlled conditions"
   - "The sample was analyzed for contaminants"

---

## Conversion Strategies

### Strategy 1: Identify the Agent
Who or what performs the action?
- **Passive**: "Settings are updated"
- **Ask**: Who updates them? → **You** or **The user**
- **Active**: "You update settings"

### Strategy 2: Use Imperative for Instructions
Commands are naturally active.
- **Passive**: "The form should be filled out"
- **Active**: "Fill out the form"

### Strategy 3: Make the System the Subject
For automated actions.
- **Passive**: "Notifications are sent automatically"
- **Active**: "The system sends notifications automatically"

### Strategy 4: Use "You" for User Actions
Direct address is clearer.
- **Passive**: "The following steps must be completed by the user"
- **Active**: "You must complete the following steps"

### Strategy 5: Break Complex Passive Sentences
Split compound passives into simpler active sentences.
- **Passive**: "Once the installation is completed and verification is performed, deployment can be initiated"
- **Active**: "After you complete the installation and perform verification, you can initiate deployment"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Adding Unnecessary Agents
- **Wrong**: "You are shown the available options"
- **Right**: "The system shows available options" OR "You see available options"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Creating Awkward Active Sentences
- **Wrong**: "The application performs the displaying of data"
- **Right**: "The application displays data"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Over-using "You"
- **Wrong**: "You are configured by you"
- **Right**: "You configure [the item]"

## Key Principles for AI Conversion

When converting passive to active:

1. **Identify the agent** (who/what does the action)
2. **Make the agent the subject** of the sentence
3. **Use active verbs** (not "is done", use "does")
4. **Keep it concise** - don't add extra words
5. **Preserve meaning** - don't change technical details
6. **Use direct address** - "you" for user actions, "system" for automated actions
