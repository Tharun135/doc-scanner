# Technical Writing Style Guide

## Voice and Tone
- Use active voice instead of passive voice
- Example: "Click the button" instead of "The button should be clicked"
- Keep sentences direct and clear

## Sentence Structure
- Keep sentences under 25 words when possible
- Break long sentences at natural conjunctions (and, but, or)
- Example: Long: "Navigate to the settings page and click on the configuration tab and then select the advanced options."
- Better: "Navigate to the settings page. Click on the configuration tab. Then select the advanced options."

## Word Choice
- Use "click" instead of "click on"
- Remove unnecessary adverbs like "previously", "currently", "actually"
- Example: "Select the file exported previously" → "Select the exported file"

## Passive Voice Examples
Bad: "The file is generated in the output folder"
Good: "The system generates the file in the output folder"

Bad: "The data can be processed by the application"
Good: "The application can process the data"

## Technical Procedures
- Start with action verbs (Click, Select, Open, Configure)
- Use imperative mood
- Be specific about locations and elements

Example procedure:
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to Settings > Advanced
3. Click the Configure button
4. Select your options
5. Click Save

## Common Improvements
- "in order to" → "to"
- "it is important to" → remove or rephrase
- "please note that" → remove
- "you only get" → "you get" (remove limiting adverbs)
