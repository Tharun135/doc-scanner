Summary of Changes Made to Fix Hyphen/Dash Rule
===============================================

Problem: The "Punctuation issue: Hyphen/dash usage issue" was being detected for 
sentences ending with periods, which should not be flagged as hyphen/dash issues.

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The sentence splitting function was removing periods during splitting
2. This meant sentences ending with periods couldn't be properly identified
3. The hyphen/dash detection was running on all sentences without distinguishing 
   between normal sentence endings and actual hyphen/dash issues

Changes Made:
=============

1. Fixed Sentence Splitting (line 93 in punctuation.py):
   OLD: sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', content)
   NEW: sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\\s+', content)
   
   This preserves the ending punctuation so we can identify normal sentence endings.

2. Enhanced Hyphen/Dash Detection (lines 186-210 in punctuation.py):
   - Added explicit check for sentences ending with periods
   - Modified compound modifier detection to exclude sentence endings
   - Improved spaced hyphen detection to avoid false positives at sentence boundaries
   - Maintained detection of actual hyphen/dash issues (double hyphens, spaced hyphens)

Results:
========

✅ FIXED: Sentences ending with periods no longer trigger hyphen/dash issues
   - "This is a normal sentence." → No issues
   - "Multiple sentences. With periods." → No issues

✅ PRESERVED: Actual hyphen/dash problems are still detected
   - "This uses -- double hyphens" → Detects double hyphen issue
   - "Text with - spaced hyphen - here" → Detects spaced hyphen issue
   - "Badly written sentence" → Detects compound modifier issue

✅ MAINTAINED: Edge cases work correctly
   - "Sentence with -- double hyphen." → Still detects double hyphen even with period
   - "Text with - spaced - in middle." → Still detects spaced hyphen even with period

Testing Results:
================
All test cases pass successfully:
- Normal sentences with periods: No false positives
- Actual hyphen/dash issues: Correctly detected
- Mixed scenarios: Handled appropriately

The fix is now live in the Flask application running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
