# Test Document for Final Verification

This document tests the sentence splitting fix for formatting elements.

You can choose to set any project to Autostart mode by activating the **Enable Autostart** option. This sentence should remain complete and not be truncated.

Here is another test with an image reference 176617096203-d2e2393 that should not break the sentence flow. The sentence continues after the image reference.

This sentence contains a [helpful link](https://example.com) that should not cause splitting. The link is embedded within the sentence structure.

**Bold text at start** of sentence should work properly. And sentences ending with **bold formatting** should also work.

Multiple formatting in one sentence: you can **bold text**, add [links](https://test.com), and reference images 12345-abcde within the same sentence without issues.
