This is a test document for batch processing. The document contains some long sentences that should be detected by the analysis system. This sentence is intentionally very long and complex to test the long sentence detection rule and see if it triggers the appropriate feedback from the document scanner application. Additionally, we will test repeated repeated words to check if the repeated word detection works properly.
