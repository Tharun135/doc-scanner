# Sentence Highlighting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The issue where sentences show as "[Sentence 2]" instead of being highlighted occurs because:

1. **Text Analysis vs Display Mismatch**: 
   - Analyzed sentences are plain text: "This sentence has bold text."
   - Display content has HTML: "This sentence has `<strong>bold text</strong>`."

2. **Highlighting Logic Fails**: 
   - The frontend tries to find exact matches between plain text sentences and HTML content
   - When formatting elements exist, exact matches fail
   - The system falls back to showing `[Sentence X]` markers

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Backend Improvements** (`app.py`)

**Enhanced Sentence Extraction:**
```python
def extract_sentences_from_html(html_content):
    # Returns both plain_text and html_context for each sentence
    sentences.append({
        'plain_text': sentence,
        'html_context': html_version
    })
```

**Updated Data Structure:**
- Each sentence now includes `html_context` field
- This provides the frontend with better matching data

### 2. **Frontend Improvements** (`index.html`)

**Enhanced Highlighting Logic:**
- **Improved Word-Based Matching**: More flexible regex patterns that handle HTML tags between words
- **Sentence Boundary Extension**: Automatically extends matches to complete sentence boundaries
- **Better HTML Tag Handling**: Allows for `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>` tags within sentence matches

**New Pattern Matching:**
```javascript
// Flexible pattern that allows HTML tags and whitespace between words
const flexiblePattern = escapedWords.join('(?:\\s*<[^>]*>\\s*|\\s+)+');

// Extends match to include complete sentence boundaries
if (beforeResult) extendedMatch = beforeResult[1] + extendedMatch;
if (afterResult) extendedMatch = extendedMatch + afterResult[1];
```

### 3. **Key Improvements**

#### ✅ **Before (Problematic)**
- Plain text sentence: "This has bold text."
- HTML content: "This has `<strong>bold text</strong>`."
- Result: No match found → Shows "[Sentence 1]"

#### ✅ **After (Fixed)**
- Same plain text and HTML
- Flexible pattern matching finds: "This has `<strong>bold text</strong>`."
- Result: Proper highlighting with formatting preserved

### 4. **Technical Details**

**Improved Matching Strategy:**
1. **Direct Match**: Try exact text match first
2. **Flexible Pattern**: Use word-based regex that allows HTML tags
3. **Boundary Extension**: Extend matches to complete sentences
4. **Fallback**: Only show "[Sentence X]" as absolute last resort

**HTML Tag Handling:**
- Inline formatting (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`) preserved within sentences
- Pattern allows: `word1 + (HTML tags + whitespace) + word2 + ...`
- Automatically reconstructs complete sentence boundaries

### 5. **Expected Results**

With these fixes:
- ✅ Sentences with **bold text** will be highlighted properly
- ✅ Sentences with [links] will be highlighted properly  
- ✅ Sentences with *italic* text will be highlighted properly
- ✅ Mixed formatting will be handled correctly
- ✅ "[Sentence X]" markers should rarely appear
- ✅ Complete sentences preserved with all formatting

### 6. **Testing**

The improvements handle these scenarios:
- Bold text in sentences: `<p>This has <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>`
- Links in sentences: `<p>Click <a href="#">this link</a> here.</p>`
- Multiple formatting: `<p>Text with <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>.</p>`
- Complex documents with various formatting combinations

### 7. **Fallback Behavior**

If highlighting still fails (rare cases):
- System logs specific matching attempts
- Provides detailed console output for debugging
- Falls back gracefully to "[Sentence X]" only when absolutely necessary
- Maintains full functionality even with highlighting issues

## Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: Proper highlighting instead of generic markers
- **Preserved Formatting**: All text formatting maintained in highlights
- **Robust Matching**: Works with complex document structures
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality unchanged

The highlighting system is now much more robust and should properly highlight sentences even when they contain formatting elements.
