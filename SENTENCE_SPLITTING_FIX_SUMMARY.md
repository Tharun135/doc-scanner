# Sentence Splitting Fix - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Premature Sentence Splitting on Formatting Elements
**Problem**: Sentences were being split at HTML formatting elements (bold, links, images) instead of treating them as single sentences until proper punctuation.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `extract_sentences_from_html()` function to use spaCy for intelligent sentence boundary detection
- Improved regex fallback patterns to handle inline formatting
- Preserved HTML context for better highlighting

### 2. Highlighting Issues
**Problem**: Some sentences showed "[Sentence X]" markers instead of proper highlighting.

**Solution**:
- Updated frontend JavaScript with flexible pattern matching
- Enhanced regex patterns to handle HTML tags within sentences
- Improved sentence boundary extension logic

## Technical Changes

### Backend (app/app.py)
- **extract_sentences_from_html()**: New function using spaCy + BeautifulSoup for intelligent sentence extraction
- **Fallback regex**: Improved pattern: `r'([.!?]+)\s+(?=[A-Z])'` to avoid splitting on inline elements
- **Data structure**: Returns dictionary with 'plain_text' and 'html_context' for each sentence

### Frontend (app/templates/index.html)
- **Pattern matching**: Enhanced regex to handle HTML tags within sentences
- **Boundary extension**: Better logic to find complete sentence boundaries
- **Fallback highlighting**: Robust handling when exact matches aren't found

### Rule Modules (app/rules/*.py)
- **Consistency**: Updated all 8 rule modules with improved `_split_into_sentences()` function
- **Pattern**: Changed from `r'[.!?]+'` to `r'([.!?]+)\s+(?=[A-Z])'` for better splitting

## Test Results

✅ **Inline formatting preserved**: Sentences with bold, links, images, etc. remain as single units
✅ **Proper boundaries**: Multiple sentences in paragraphs correctly split at punctuation + capital letter
✅ **HTML context preserved**: Both plain text and HTML available for highlighting
✅ **No false positives**: Formatting elements don't cause unwanted sentence breaks

## Example Improvements

**Before**: 
- "This sentence has" | "bold text" | "in the middle."
- "[Sentence 2]" markers instead of highlighting

**After**: 
- "This sentence has bold text in the middle." (single sentence)
- Proper highlighting with HTML context preserved

## Files Modified
- `app/app.py` - Core sentence extraction logic
- `app/templates/index.html` - Frontend highlighting improvements  
- `app/rules/*.py` - All rule modules updated for consistency
- Added comprehensive test files for validation

The system now correctly handles complex formatting while maintaining sentence integrity and proper highlighting functionality.
