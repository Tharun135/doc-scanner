    This is a test document for the enhanced circular progress UI.
    
    The system should display a beautiful circular progress indicator.
    You should see a rotating gradient ring with percentage in the center.
    Below that, there should be a linear progress bar with shimmer effects.
    At the bottom, four stage indicator dots should light up as progress advances.
    
    This enhancement makes the waiting experience much more engaging.
    The glassmorphism design creates a modern, professional appearance.
