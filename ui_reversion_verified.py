✅ Upload Functionality: Working (logs show successful uploads)
✅ Backend: 8 rules + RAG system still functional
✅ Punctuation Fix: Still applied (no false positives for periods)

File Changes Made:
==================
📁 app/templates/index.html:
  - Line ~620: Header changed to "Document Analysis"
  - Line ~612: Button cleaned of RAG badge
  - Line ~265: Removed .rag-badge CSS
  - Line ~1399: Removed RAG badges from suggestions

Verification:
=============
The Simple Browser should now show:

- Original Doc Scanner appearance
- No RAG branding visible to users

Backend functionality is preserved - the RAG system still works
behind the scenes but doesn't show RAG-specific branding.
