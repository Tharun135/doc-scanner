# Testing the Progressive Analysis Feature

## How to Test

1. **Open the Application**: 
   - Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser
   - Make sure the Flask application is running

2. **Upload a Document**:
   - Click "Choose File" or drag and drop a document
   - Use the `demo_document.txt` file created for testing
   - Click "Upload & Analyze"

3. **Observe the Progress**:
   You should see:
   - **Progress Overlay**: Dark background with centered progress container
   - **Animated Progress Bar**: Fills from 0% to 100% with shine effect
   - **Percentage Display**: Large number showing current progress
   - **Stage Indicators**: Icons and text showing current processing stage
   - **Status Messages**: Detailed descriptions of what's happening

## Expected Progress Stages

1. **Parsing (0-10%)**: "Parsing [filename]..."
2. **Segmentation (10-20%)**: "Breaking down into sentences..."
3. **Analysis (20-90%)**: "Analyzing sentence X of Y..."
4. **Reporting (90-95%)**: "Generating analysis report..."
5. **Complete (100%)**: "Analysis complete!" with green progress bar

## Fallback Behavior

If the progressive analysis fails (which might happen if routes aren't working):
- You'll see error messages explaining what went wrong
- The system will automatically fall back to standard upload
- You'll still see progress indicators for the fallback process

## Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab to see:
- Debug messages about progressive upload attempts
- Progress polling status
- Any errors that might occur

## Visual Features

- **Animated Icons**: Brain icon rotates during analysis
- **Color Changes**: Progress bar turns green when complete
- **Browser Title**: Shows progress percentage in the tab title
- **Smooth Animations**: All progress updates are smoothly animated

## What You Should See

The main improvement is that instead of just seeing a spinning loader, you now get:
- Real-time percentage completion
- Clear indication of which processing stage is active
- Specific messages about what's being processed
- Professional, polished progress display

This makes the analysis process much more transparent and user-friendly, especially for larger documents that take longer to process.
