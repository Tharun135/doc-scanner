TO TEST THE FIX:

1. üîÑ RESTART YOUR SERVER:
   - Stop the current document scanner server
   - Start it again to load the enhanced message generation code

2. üì§ UPLOAD THE SAME DOCUMENT:
   - Use the exact document that was showing unclear issues
   - The one with "appropriate", "hardware, firmware and operating", etc.

3. ‚úÖ VERIFY THE RESULTS:
   Instead of seeing:
   ‚ùå "Issue: appropriate"
   ‚ùå "Issue: Security guidelines for usage of USB sticks..."
   
   You should now see:
   ‚úÖ "Issue: Be specific instead of 'appropriate': define what makes it suitable"
   ‚úÖ "Issue: Possible passive voice detected - consider active voice"

4. üîç IF STILL UNCLEAR:
   - Check browser developer tools (F12) > Network tab
   - Look at the upload response to see if messages are enhanced
   - Clear browser cache to avoid caching issues

5. üìù REPORT RESULTS:
   - If fixed: Great! The enhancement worked
   - If still unclear: Share the new output for further debugging
