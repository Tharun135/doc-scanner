# Sentence Splitting Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The sentence identification system had two main issues:

1. **Bold text splitting**: When markdown contained `**bold words**`, the system would split sentences incorrectly:
   - "This sentence has a **bold word** in the middle" became 3 separate sentences:
     - "This sentence has a"
     - "bold word" 
     - "in the middle"

2. **Image reference splitting**: When markdown contained image references like `176617096203-d2e2393`, similar splitting occurred.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the text extraction process in `app/app.py` around line 618:

```python
# OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC)
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
plain_text = soup.get_text(separator="\n")  # This caused newlines around formatting tags
```

When markdown like `**bold**` was converted to HTML `<strong>bold</strong>`, BeautifulSoup's `get_text(separator="\n")` would insert newlines around the tags, breaking sentence continuity.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Text Extraction
- Changed from newline separator to space separator
- Added text normalization to clean up excessive whitespace
- Preserved sentence boundaries properly

```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED)
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
plain_text = soup.get_text(separator=" ")  # Use space instead of newline
# Clean up excessive whitespace and normalize text
plain_text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', plain_text)
plain_text = re.sub(r'\s+([.!?])', r'\1', plain_text)
plain_text = re.sub(r'([.!?])([A-Z])', r'\1 \2', plain_text)
```

### 2. Improved Paragraph Processing
- Extract text from HTML elements (p, h1-h6) separately
- Process each block individually for sentence splitting
- Skip very short fragments (< 3 characters)

### 3. Enhanced Sentence Segmentation
- Use spaCy for accurate sentence boundary detection when available
- Improved regex fallback for when spaCy is not available
- Better handling of edge cases

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
Sentence 1: "This sentence has a"
Sentence 2: "bold word" 
Sentence 3: "in the middle which might cause splitting problems."
```

### After Fix:
```
Sentence 1: "This sentence has a bold word in the middle which might cause splitting problems."
```

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Multiple formatting in one sentence**: `**bold** and *italic* and `code``
- **Nested formatting**: `**Bold _italic_ text** with nested `code``
- **URLs**: Sentences containing URLs remain intact
- **Image references**: `176617096203-d2e2393` patterns don't break sentences
- **Mixed content**: Sentences with bold, code, and image references together

## Files Modified

- `app/app.py`: Lines 615-665 (text extraction and sentence processing)

## Files Added for Testing

- `test_sentence_splitting_issue.md`: Original test case
- `test_sentence_split_debug.py`: Debug script to show the problem
- `test_improved_split.py`: Test script to verify the fix
- `test_edge_cases.md`: Edge case test document
- `test_edge_cases_debug.py`: Edge case verification script

## Verification

The fix has been tested with:
1. Basic bold text cases
2. Image reference cases  
3. Mixed formatting cases
4. Complex nested formatting
5. URLs and special characters
6. List items and headers

All tests pass successfully, showing that sentences are now properly identified regardless of markdown formatting.
