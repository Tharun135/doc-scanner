# Custom Terminology Solution Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: The word "runtime" was being flagged as a spelling error with the suggestion "untie", when "runtime" is actually correct in the context of "WinCC Unified Runtime app supports the configuration..."

**Root Cause**: The spell checker didn't have a way to maintain a custom whitelist of technical/domain-specific terms that should be ignored during spell checking.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom Terminology System
- **File**: `app/simple_terminology.py`
- **Purpose**: Maintains a whitelist of technical terms that should be skipped during spell checking
- **Includes**: 53+ pre-configured terms including "runtime", "wincc", "siemens", "plc", "hmi", etc.

### 2. Spell Checker Integration
- **File**: `app/rules/spelling_checker.py` (modified)
- **Integration**: The spell checker now checks the custom terminology whitelist before flagging words
- **Behavior**: Words in the whitelist are skipped entirely, preventing false positives

### 3. Management Tools
- **File**: `manage_terms.py`
- **Commands**: 
  - `python manage_terms.py check runtime` → `runtime: YES`
  - `python manage_terms.py check untie` → `untie: NO`
  - `python manage_terms.py list` → Shows all whitelisted terms
  - `python manage_terms.py count` → Shows total term count

## Results

### Before Implementation
```
Text: "WinCC Unified Runtime app supports the configuration"
Result: Multiple spelling errors flagged for "WinCC", "Runtime", etc.
```

### After Implementation
```
Text: "WinCC Unified Runtime app supports the configuration"
Result: ✓ No spelling issues - 'runtime' correctly ignored!
```

### Still Catches Real Errors
```
Text: "Configuraton settings"
Result: Spelling: 'Configuraton' should be 'Configuration'
```

## Technical Architecture

```
Spell Checker Flow:
1. Text input → Extract words
2. Check custom terminology whitelist
   - If whitelisted → Skip word (no error)
   - If not whitelisted → Continue to spell check
3. Run spell checking algorithms
4. Return suggestions for non-whitelisted misspellings
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/simple_terminology.py` - Custom terminology management
- `app/rules/custom_terminology.json` - Configuration file (backup)
- `manage_terms.py` - Command-line management tool
- `CUSTOM_TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/rules/spelling_checker.py` - Integrated custom terminology checking

## Key Features

1. **Case Insensitive**: "runtime", "Runtime", "RUNTIME" all match
2. **Category Organization**: Terms grouped by domain (industrial, software, acronyms)
3. **Easy Management**: Simple command-line tools for checking/adding terms
4. **Performance Optimized**: Early filtering prevents expensive spell checking
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new terms as needed

## Usage Examples

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Check if runtime is whitelisted
python manage_terms.py check runtime
# Output: runtime: YES

# See total terms
python manage_terms.py count  
# Output: Total custom terms: 53
```

### Add New Terms
Edit `app/simple_terminology.py` and add to `DEFAULT_TERMS` list:
```python
DEFAULT_TERMS = [
    # ... existing terms ...
    "mynewterm",
    "anotherterm"
]
```

### Test Spell Checking
```python
from app.rules.spelling_checker import check

# This will not flag runtime as misspelled
text = "WinCC Unified Runtime app supports configuration"
suggestions = check(text)
# Result: [] (no suggestions)

# This will still catch real misspellings
text = "The configuraton is wrong"  
suggestions = check(text)
# Result: ['Spelling: "configuraton" should be "configuration"']
```

## Validation

The solution has been tested and proven to:

✅ **Correctly ignore "runtime"** - No longer flagged as misspelling  
✅ **Still catch real errors** - "configuraton" → "configuration"  
✅ **Handle case variations** - "Runtime", "RUNTIME" also ignored  
✅ **Support other technical terms** - "wincc", "scada", "plc", etc.  
✅ **Maintain performance** - No significant slowdown  
✅ **Easy to extend** - Simple to add new terms  

## Next Steps

1. **Add domain-specific terms** as needed for your specific use case
2. **Test with real documents** to identify additional terms to whitelist
3. **Train team members** on using `manage_terms.py` for checking terms
4. **Consider automation** for bulk term imports if needed

The custom terminology system provides a robust, maintainable solution for handling technical vocabulary while preserving the spell checker's ability to catch genuine misspellings.
