"""
Additional memory optimizations for better performance:

1. Limit string operations
2. Use string formatting instead of concatenation
3. Clean up large objects explicitly
4. Use generators instead of lists where possible
"""

# Example optimizations:

# BEFORE (slower):
# guidance = "Remove " + word + " to improve " + quality + " and " + speed

# AFTER (faster):
# guidance = f"Remove {word} to improve {quality} and {speed}"

# BEFORE (memory intensive):
# all_results = [process(item) for item in large_list]
# return all_results[0]

# AFTER (memory efficient):
# for item in large_list:
#     result = process(item)
#     if result:
#         return result

# Memory cleanup after heavy operations:
# del large_object
# import gc; gc.collect()  # Only if really needed
