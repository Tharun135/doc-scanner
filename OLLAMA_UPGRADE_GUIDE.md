## üìö Custom Knowledge

Add your own writing guidelines to enhance AI suggestions:

```

This creates `custom_writing_rules.json` with sample rules for:
- Technical writing style
- Clear error messages  
- Direct addressing ("you" vs "the user")
- Definitive language

### 2. Add Your Own Rules
Edit `custom_writing_rules.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Use 'you' instead of 'the user' for direct communication",
    "category": "technical_writing",
    "examples": ["Click the button", "Enter your password"]
  },
  {
    "text": "Write error messages that explain what to do next", 
    "category": "error_handling",
    "examples": ["File not found. Check the path and try again."]
  }
]
```

### 3. Types of Custom Knowledge to Add
- **Company Style Guides**: Brand voice, terminology preferences
- **Industry Standards**: Medical, legal, technical conventions  
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge for your field
- **Personal Preferences**: Your writing style and patterns

### 4. Auto-Loading
Custom rules are automatically loaded when DocScanner starts. No code changes needed!

## üéØ Fine-Tuning (Advanced)

Train models specifically for your writing style:

### Method 1: Ollama Modelfile (Simple)

1. **Create a Modelfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM phi3:mini

SYSTEM """You are a technical writing assistant.

Writing Style:
- Use active voice
- Write in present tense  
- Use "you" instead of "the user"
- Be direct and specific
- Include practical examples
"""
```

2. **Create your custom model**:
```bash
ollama create my-writing-model -f Modelfile
```

3. **Update DocScanner**:
Edit `scripts/docscanner_ollama_rag.py`, change:
```python
def __init__(self, model="my-writing-model"):
```

### Method 2: LoRA Fine-Tuning (Advanced)

1. **Collect Training Data**: 100+ examples of your writing style
2. **Format as JSONL**:
```json
{"instruction": "Fix passive voice: The report was written by John", "response": "John wrote the report"}
{"instruction": "Make this more direct: Users might want to click save", "response": "Click Save to continue"}
```

3. **Use Training Libraries**: 
   - [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) - Fast LoRA training
   - [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) - Full training pipeline

4. **Export to Ollama**: Convert trained model to Ollama format

## üí° Pro Tips

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Model Installation Fails
- Check disk space (models can be 4GB+)
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Try smaller models first

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications to free RAM
- Use smaller models (phi3:mini vs llama3:8b)
- Increase Ollama timeout settings

### Custom Rules Not Working
- Check JSON syntax in `custom_writing_rules.json`
- Restart DocScanner after adding rules
- Verify rules are specific and actionable
