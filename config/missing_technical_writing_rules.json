    "explanation": "Remove weak adverbs like 'easily', 'simply', 'basically', 'manually', 'automatically', 'actually', 'really' that add no value.",
    "why": "Adverbs often weaken writing and make instructions seem uncertain. Direct language is clearer.",
    "examples": {
      "bad": ["You can easily configure the settings", "Simply click the button", "To manually input data"],
      "good": ["Configure the settings", "Click the button", "To input data"]

    "rule_id": "MOD-modal_verbs",
    "title": "Avoid Weak Modal Verbs",
    "explanation": "Replace 'can', 'may', 'should', 'will' with direct imperative language in instructions.",
    "why": "Modal verbs create uncertainty in technical instructions. Users need clear, definitive guidance.",
    "examples": {
      "bad": ["You should click Save", "You can now proceed", "You may select options", "You will be able to see"],
      "good": ["Click Save", "Proceed to next step", "Select your options", "You can see"]

    "rule_id": "MOD-ui_interactions", 
    "title": "Simplify UI Interaction Language",
    "explanation": "Use 'click' instead of 'click on', 'select' instead of 'select on'. Remove unnecessary prepositions.",
    "why": "Shorter, more direct language reduces cognitive load and sounds more natural.",
    "examples": {
      "bad": ["Click on the button", "Select on the option", "Choose from the menu"],

    "rule_id": "MOD-capitalization",
    "title": "Fix Inconsistent Capitalization", 
    "explanation": "Avoid ALL CAPS for emphasis. Use sentence case for UI elements unless they appear in ALL CAPS in the interface.",
    "why": "ALL CAPS appears like shouting and reduces readability. Consistent capitalization improves professionalism.",
    "examples": {

    "title": "Remove Filler Words",
    "explanation": "Eliminate words like 'just', 'really', 'very', 'quite', 'rather', 'somewhat', 'pretty much'.",
    "why": "Filler words add no meaning and make writing verbose. Every word should add value.",
    "examples": {

    "explanation": "Remove phrases like 'in order to' (use 'to'), 'due to the fact that' (use 'because'), 'at this point in time' (use 'now').",
    "why": "Concise writing is clearer and faster to read. Redundant phrases waste the reader's time.",
    "examples": {
