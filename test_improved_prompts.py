TASK: Provide a complete rewritten sentence that fixes the specific issue identified.

GUIDELINES:
- For adverb placement issues: Move the adverb closer to the word it modifies
- For passive voice: Convert to active voice showing who performs the action  
- For long sentences: Break into shorter, clearer sentences
- Preserve original meaning while improving clarity
- Use "Application" instead of "technical writer"

WRITING GOALS: {', '.join(writing_goals)}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You must provide a complete rewritten sentence that fixes the specific issue
2. For adverb issues (like "only"), reposition the adverb to clarify meaning
3. For passive voice, convert to active voice
4. For long sentences, break into shorter, clearer sentences
5. Preserve the original meaning while improving clarity
6. Use "Application" instead of "technical writer" in your suggestions

REQUIRED FORMAT:
IMPROVED_SENTENCE: [Complete rewritten sentence that fixes the issue]
EXPLANATION: [Brief explanation of what you changed and why it's better]

EXAMPLE FOR ADVERB ISSUES:
- If original: "You only get basic access"
- Consider: "You get only basic access" (if limiting access type) OR "Only you get basic access" (if limiting who gets access)
- Choose based on the intended meaning in context
