A further Industrial Edge app called Flow Creator is used to send downlink commands to the connector for LoRaWan and detect where the data is to be sent to.

The report was completed by the team last week.

Data is processed by the system automatically.

User authentication is handled by the security module.

The configuration files are generated by the application during startup.
