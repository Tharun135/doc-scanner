# Doc-Scanner: RAG-Enhanced AI Writing Assistant

## ðŸš€ Executive Summary

Doc-Scanner is an advanced document analysis application that combines traditional rule-based writing analysis with cutting-edge **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology powered by Google Gemini AI. The application provides intelligent, context-aware writing suggestions that go far beyond simple grammar checking.

## ðŸ§  Core AI Technologies

### 1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**

The heart of our AI enhancement is a sophisticated RAG implementation that provides contextual writing suggestions:

#### **How RAG Works in Doc-Scanner:**

    ```
    User's Text Input â†’ Rule Detection â†’ RAG Context Retrieval â†’ AI Enhancement â†’ Intelligent Suggestion
    ```

#### **RAG Components:**

- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with Google embeddings for semantic search
- **Knowledge Base**: 39+ writing rules converted to searchable embeddings
- **LLM**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for generating contextual responses
- **Document Context**: Current document content added to knowledge base
- **Writing Guidelines**: Comprehensive style guide embedded as searchable content

### 2. **Smart Fallback Architecture**

    ```python
    if RAG_AVAILABLE and api_quota_available:
        return enhanced_rag_suggestion()
    else:
        return rule_based_fallback()
    ```

### 3. **Multi-Modal AI Enhancement**

- **Primary**: Google Gemini + LangChain RAG
- **Secondary**: Rule-based pattern matching
- **Tertiary**: Learning system from user feedback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### **RAG System Flow:**

1. **Document Upload/Input**
   - User uploads document (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown)
   - Content extracted and parsed

2. **Rule-Based Analysis**
   - 39+ writing rules scan content for issues
   - Traditional pattern matching identifies problems

3. **RAG Enhancement**
   - Issues sent to RAG system with document context
   - Semantic search of rule knowledge base
   - Google Gemini generates contextual suggestions
   - AI considers document type, writing goals, and context

4. **Intelligent Response**
   - Complete sentence rewrites (not just corrections)
   - Multiple options provided
   - Technical explanations included
   - Source attribution from rule knowledge

### **Key RAG Features:**

#### **Context-Aware Analysis**

    ```python
    # RAG considers multiple context layers:
    query = f"""
    Writing issue: {feedback_text}
    Sentence: '{sentence_context}'
    Document type: {document_type}
    Relevant rules: {rule_context}
    How to improve this writing issue?
    """
    ```

#### **Intelligent Prompt Engineering**

    ```python
    prompt_template = """
    You are a technical writing assistant. Analyze the provided sentence and rewrite it completely.

    Rules:
    - IMPORTANT: Rewrite the ENTIRE sentence, not just the problematic part
    - Use active voice when possible
    - Be direct and user-focused
    - Suitable for technical documentation

    Format:
    OPTION 1: [Complete sentence rewrite]
    OPTION 2: [Alternative complete sentence rewrite] 
    WHY: [Brief technical explanation]
    """
    ```
